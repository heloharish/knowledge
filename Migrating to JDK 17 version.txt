  // Refactor to remove reliance on SecurityManager or use modern security practices
  ```

#### Challenge 3: New Language Features

**Problem**: Adopting new features requires some refactoring and understanding of new syntax.

**Solution**:
- **Incremental Adoption**: Gradually introduce new language features, such as records or pattern matching, where they naturally improve code clarity or performance. 

- **Code Example (Record)**:
  ```java
  // Traditional Java
  public class Point {
      private final int x;
      private final int y;
      // constructor, getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString()
  }

  // Simplified using Records
  public record Point(int x, int y) {}
  ```

#### Challenge 4: Performance Tuning

**Problem**: Performance characteristics may vary, impacting server load and memory management.

**Solution**:
- **Profiling and Benchmarking**: Profile your application using tools such as JVisualVM to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **GC Tuning**: JDK 17 includes improvements to the G1 and ZGC garbage collectors. Fine-tune GC settings based on application behavior.

### Conclusion

Migrating to JDK 17 involves updating dependencies, refactoring code for API changes, and adopting new features for improved code quality and performance. By understanding the challenges, employing careful planning, and implementing strategic solutions, you can leverage JDK 17's advancements while maintaining application stability and reliability. Investing time in thorough testing and validation during the transition will minimize disruptions and ensure a successful migration.

JDK 17 is a significant release given its status as a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, which means it will receive extended support and updates. It arrives with improvements, new features, and the culmination of enhancements from previous interim releases (14, 15, and 16). Here’s a detailed overview of the prominent new features and improvements added in JDK 17:

### 1. Language Features

#### a. Sealed Classes (JEP 409)
- **Purpose**: Restrict which classes can extend or implement a particular class or interface.
- **Use Case**: Enhance code safety and clarity by controlling class hierarchies.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  public abstract sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Square {
    // Class definition
  }
  
  public final class Circle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
  public final class Rectangle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
  ```

#### b. Pattern Matching for `switch` (Preview) (JEP 406)
- **Purpose**: Simplify complex data-oriented structures and conditions.
- **Use Case**: Improve and clarify conditional logic with type-safe pattern matching.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  switch (object) {
      case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
      case String s -> System.out.println("String: " + s);
      default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
  }
  ```

### 2. New Library Features

#### a. Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator) (JEP 412)
