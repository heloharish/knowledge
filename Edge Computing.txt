### What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data, such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity reduces latency, improves response times, and optimizes bandwidth usage. Instead of sending all data to a centralized cloud or data center, edge computing processes data locally, enabling faster and more efficient operations.

### Key Benefits of Edge Computing
- **Reduced Latency**: Data is processed closer to its source, minimizing delays.
- **Improved Bandwidth Efficiency**: Only essential data is sent to the cloud, reducing network congestion.
- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive data can be processed locally, adhering to data sovereignty and privacy regulations.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Enables immediate data analysis for applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and industrial automation.
