Below is a detailed explanation of each topic listed, providing insights into key Spring Framework concepts and related technologies:

### 1. Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
- **Q**: What is Dependency Injection in Spring?
  - **A**: DI is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. In Spring, dependencies are injected using constructors, setters, or field injection.

- **Q**: How does Inversion of Control work?
  - **A**: IoC inverts the control of creating and managing objects. Instead of the object controlling its dependencies, the Spring container manages them, promoting loose coupling and easier testability.

### 2. Bean Lifecycle and Scopes
- **Q**: What is the lifecycle of a Spring Bean?
  - **A**: The lifecycle includes instantiation, dependency injection, initialization via `@PostConstruct` or after properties set, usage, and destruction via `@PreDestroy` or close methods.

- **Q**: What are the different bean scopes in Spring?
  - **A**: Common scopes include `singleton`, `prototype`, `request`, `session`, and `globalSession`, used primarily in web applications.

### 3. ApplicationContext and BeanFactory
- **Q**: What is BeanFactory?
  - **A**: BeanFactory is the root interface for accessing the Spring container and provides the basic functionality to manage beans.

- **Q**: How does ApplicationContext differ from BeanFactory?
  - **A**: ApplicationContext builds on BeanFactory, adding features like event publishing, internationalization, and automatic BeanPostProcessor registration.

### 4. XML vs. Java-based Configuration
- **Q**: What is XML configuration in Spring?
  - **A**: XML configuration involves defining beans and dependencies in an XML file. It was the original method used in Spring.

- **Q**: What is Java-based Configuration?
  - **A**: Java-based configuration uses `@Configuration` classes and `@Bean` methods. It is favored in modern Spring applications due to its type-safety and readability.

### 5. Annotations: @Component, @Autowired, @Qualifier, @Value
- **Q**: What does `@Component` do?
  - **A**: It marks a class as a Spring-managed component, which is autodetected during classpath scanning.

- **Q**: How is `@Autowired` used?
  - **A**: `@Autowired` injects dependencies automatically by type. It's used on fields, setters, and constructors.

- **Q**: When is `@Qualifier` necessary?
  - **A**: It specifies which bean to inject when multiple candidates match.

- **Q**: How does `@Value` function?
  - **A**: It injects property values, typically from `application.properties` or environment variables.

  - **A**: Pointcuts define when advice should be applied, such as method execution.

- **Q**: What is Advice?
  - **A**: Action taken by an aspect at a particular pointcut. Types include `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`.

- **Q**: Define Joinpoint.
  - **A**: A point during execution (like method execution) where advice can be applied.

- **Q**: Explain Aspects.
  - **A**: A module containing advice, defining cross-cutting concerns.

### 7. Common AOP annotations: @Aspect, @Before, @After
- **Q**: What does `@Aspect` signify?
  - **A**: Marks a class as an aspect, a central concept in AOP.

- **Q**: How is `@Before` used?
  - **A**: Executes advice before a matched method execution.

- **Q**: When is `@After` applied?
  - **A**: Executes advice after the matched method executes, regardless of its outcome.

### 8. JDBC Template
- **Q**: What is JDBC Template?
  - **A**: It simplifies JDBC operations, reducing boilerplate by managing resource management like opening/closing connections.

### 9. Spring ORM with Hibernate

- **Q**: What are RESTful Web Services?
  - **A**: Services that adhere to REST architecture, utilizing HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations.

### 17. RequestMapping: @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
- **Q**: What purpose do mapping annotations serve?
  - **A**: They map HTTP requests to specific handler methods, simplifying request handling.

### 18. Exception Handling with @ControllerAdvice
- **Q**: How does `@ControllerAdvice` work?
  - **A**: Provides centralized exception handling across all controllers by using `@ExceptionHandler` methods.

### 19. Authentication and Authorization
- **Q**: Differentiate authentication and authorization.
  - **A**: Authentication verifies identity, while authorization determines access levels.

### 20. Security Filters and Interceptors
