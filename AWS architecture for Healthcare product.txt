When designing AWS architecture for a healthcare product, it's essential to prioritize security, compliance (such as HIPAA), scalability, and reliability. Below is a high-level architecture and implementation guide for a healthcare product using AWS services:

### AWS Architecture for Healthcare Product

1. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - Use IAM to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Implement least privilege access and monitor usage.

2. **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
   - Set up a VPC to isolate resources and enhance security. Use subnets and route tables to control traffic.

3. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
   - Deploy an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances or containers for high availability.

4. **Amazon EC2 Instances / AWS Lambda**
   - Use EC2 for running server-based applications, or leverage AWS Lambda for serverless operations where suitable to reduce management overhead.

5. **Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora**
   - Utilize managed database services with high availability and automated backups. Ensure encryption for data at rest and SSL for connections.

6. **Amazon S3**
   - Store and encrypt static files, images, and documents securely. Use S3's versioning and lifecycle policies for managing data retention.

7. **Amazon CloudFront**
   - Use CloudFront for secure delivery of content with reduced latency.

8. **Amazon API Gateway**
   - Securely expose APIs for web and mobile apps using API Gateway with integrated authorization and throttling.

9. **Amazon Cognito**
   - Implement user authentication and management through Cognito for secure user signup and sign-in flows.

10. **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**
    - Utilize KMS for secure storage of encryption keys used to encrypt application data.

11. **AWS WAF and Shield**
    - Protect against common web threats using AWS WAF. Shield provides DDoS protection.

12. **AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch**
    - Enable CloudTrail for logging and monitoring API activity and CloudWatch for performance monitoring and alert systems.

### Implementation Details in Java

1. **Develop and Secure the Application**
   - Use Spring Boot or another robust Java framework to build the healthcare product with a focus on secure coding practices.
   - Implement encryption libraries for handling sensitive data (e.g., AES, RSA).

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Manage dependencies with Maven or Gradle. Ensure libraries are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.

3. **AWS SDK Integration**
   - Integrate AWS SDK for managing resources programmatically:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-sdk-java</artifactId>
      <version>[latest_version]</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

4. **Database Configuration**
   - Connect application to Amazon RDS/Aurora database using appropriate JDBC drivers:
   ```java
   DataSource dataSource = getDataSourceBuilder()
                              .url("jdbc:mysql://<RDS_endpoint>/<db_name>")
                              .username("<username>")
                              .password("<password>")
                              .build();
   ```

5. **IAM Roles and Policies**
   - Configure IAM roles specifically for application components. Ensure roles are securely assigned and minimal privileges are provided.

6. **API Gateway Integration**
   - Create RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, and deploy via AWS API Gateway with necessary security configurations:
   ```java
   ApiGatewayClient apiGateway = ApiGatewayClient.builder().region(Region.US_EAST_1).build();
   ```

7. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement monitoring and logging inside the application using CloudWatch:
   ```java
   CloudWatchClient cloudWatch = CloudWatchClient.builder().region(Region.US_EAST_1).build();
   ```

8. **Compliance and Security**
   - Regularly audit and assess security measures within your application against industry standards and compliance requirements like HIPAA.
   - Utilize AWS compliance services for audit trails and access management.

9. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Use AWS CodeDeploy or CodePipeline for automated deployment. Consider using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for simplifying management.

10. **Backup and Recovery**
    - Enable automatic backups of your databases, using either RDS snapshots or automated scripts, and ensure S3 bucket versioning is activated for critical files.

This architecture and implementation guide provide a robust and secure foundation for developing a healthcare product on AWS, tailored to meet high standards of data security, compliance, and operational efficiency. Adhering to this architecture should help streamline your product deployment while ensuring it meets necessary regulatory requirements.
