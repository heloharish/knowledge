Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, meaning it will receive updates and support for an extended period. It introduces several new features and improvements compared to previous versions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Features of JDK 17**
1. **Sealed Classes (JEP 409)**:
   - Sealed classes allow developers to restrict which classes can extend or implement them. This improves code security and readability by explicitly defining inheritance hierarchies.

2. **Restore Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics (JEP 306)**:
   - Floating-point operations are consistently strict across platforms, ensuring predictable results for scientific and financial applications.

3. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (JEP 356)**:
   - New interfaces and implementations for pseudo-random number generators make it easier to use different algorithms and support stream-based programming.

4. **Deprecation of Applet API (JEP 398)**:
   - The Applet API is deprecated for removal, reflecting the decline in browser support for Java plugins.

5. **New macOS Rendering Pipeline (JEP 382)**:
   - A new rendering pipeline using Apple's Metal API replaces the deprecated OpenGL API, improving performance on macOS.

6. **macOS/AArch64 Port (JEP 391)**:
   - JDK 17 supports macOS on AArch64 architecture, aligning with Apple's transition to ARM-based processors.

### **Comparison with Previous Versions**
Hereâ€™s how JDK 17 stacks up against earlier versions:

| **Version** | **Key Features**                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JDK 8**   | Introduced lambdas, streams, and default methods in interfaces.                 |
| **JDK 11**  | Added HTTP Client API, local variable syntax for lambda parameters, and more.   |
| **JDK 15**  | Featured text blocks, hidden classes, and the first preview of sealed classes.  |
| **JDK 16**  | Introduced records (data classes) and improved memory management.               |
| **JDK 17**  | Focused on sealed classes, random number generators, and macOS optimizations.   |

### **Why Upgrade to JDK 17?**
- **Performance**: JDK 17 offers better startup times, throughput, and resource utilization compared to older versions.
- **Security**: Regular updates ensure protection against vulnerabilities.
- **Modern Features**: Sealed classes and enhanced random number generators simplify coding and improve functionality.

JDK 17 introduced several improvements and changes beyond the major features already discussed. Here's a detailed look at some additional enhancements:

### **Other Improvements in JDK 17**

1. **Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals (JEP 403)**:
   - By default, all internal elements of the JDK are strongly encapsulated, except for critical APIs like `sun.misc.Unsafe`. This improves security and maintainability by preventing unintended access to internal APIs.

2. **Context-Specific Deserialization Filters (JEP 415)**:
   - Applications can now configure context-specific and dynamically selected deserialization filters. This enhances security by allowing fine-grained control over deserialization operations.

3. **Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview) (JEP 406)**:
   - This feature allows switch expressions and statements to match patterns, making code more concise and readable. It simplifies complex data-oriented queries.

4. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator) (JEP 412)**:
   - This API enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. It provides a safer and more efficient alternative to JNI (Java Native Interface).

5. **Deprecation of the Security Manager (JEP 411)**:
   - The Security Manager, along with related APIs, has been deprecated for removal in a future release. This reflects the shift towards more modern security practices.

6. **Improved Garbage Collection**:
   - Enhancements to garbage collection algorithms, such as G1 and ZGC, improve performance and reduce latency for applications with large heaps.

7. **Removal of RMI Activation (JEP 407)**:
   - The Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Activation system has been removed due to its limited use and the availability of better alternatives.

8. **New APIs and Libraries**:
   - Introduction of new APIs, such as `InstantSource`, which provides a flexible way to work with time-based operations.

9. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Various under-the-hood optimizations improve startup time, memory usage, and runtime performance.
