  - **A**: Feign is a declarative REST client for simplifying HTTP API calls, integrating easily with Spring Cloud.

- **Q**: What is WebClient?
  - **A**: WebClient is part of Spring WebFlux, providing non-blocking, reactive HTTP client features.

- **Q**: When to use Feign vs WebClient?
  - **A**: Use Feign for synchronous communication with an easy-to-use interface. Use WebClient for asynchronous calls and when reactive programming is needed.

### 10. Event-driven Architecture and Kafka Integration

- **Q**: What is Event-driven architecture?
  - **A**: An architecture style focusing on producing and consuming events, ensuring loose coupling and asynchronous interaction.
